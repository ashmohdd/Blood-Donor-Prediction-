# Blood Donation Predictor: Ensuring a Steady Supply in Qatar
# Description
Blood transfusion plays a critical role in saving lives, from aiding major surgeries to treating various medical conditions. Ensuring a steady and reliable blood supply is a constant challenge for healthcare professionals. In this capstone project, we aim to develop a predictive model to assist blood banks in Qatar, specifically sourced from the Hamad Medical Center in Doha. The model will identify donors likely to return for blood donation based on a limited set of attributes, leveraging machine learning algorithms.

Our dataset comprises information collected from blood donations in Qatar, including details such as the time since the last donation, the number of previous donations, volume of donated blood, and the total months passed since the first donation. The goal is to create a robust model that can analyze historical data and predict the likelihood of donors returning for subsequent donations. The developed model will undergo evaluation using various metrics to determine its effectiveness in predicting future donor behavior.
